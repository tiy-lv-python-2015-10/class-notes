# Pig Latin

The usual rules for changing standard English into Pig Latin are as follows:

For words that begin with consonant sounds, the initial consonant or consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word, and "ay" is added, as in the following examples:

* "pig" → "igpay"
* "banana" → "ananabay"
* "trash" → "ashtray"
* "happy" → "appyhay"
* "duck" → "uckday"
* "glove" → "oveglay"

For words that begin with vowel sounds or a silent letter, you just add "way" to the end. Examples are:

* "egg" → "eggway"
* "inbox" → "inboxway"
* "eight" → "eightway"

Using test-driven development, write a function that will take a string and output the Pig Latin version of it.

Test cases you should have include:

* test for words that start with one consonant
* test for words that start with multiple consonants
* test for words that start with a vowel
* test for words that start with a capitol letter
* test for a string with two or more words
* test for a string with a sentence, including punctuation
