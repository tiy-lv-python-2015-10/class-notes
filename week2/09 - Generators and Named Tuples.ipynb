This means instead of moving through a sequence all at once the generator will iterate and calculate the value only when it's asked to - waiting until the very last minute before it has to do any work.  Hence the `lazy` term.  This is more clearly demonstrated below."

It generates a hefty amount of boilerplate code for you and all you really pass in is a Name, Keys, and Values.
