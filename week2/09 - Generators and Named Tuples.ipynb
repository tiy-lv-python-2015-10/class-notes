    "Named Tuples (from here on referred to by their syntactically correct name `namedtuple`) are possibly the quickest way to convert a primitive data structure into a Python object-like instance.  It generates a hefty amount of boilerplate code for you and all you really pass in is a Name, Keys, and Values. A `namedtuple` can be especially useful if you're working with something like a JSON Api that will pass you a flat string of data that you need to convert into something useful.  Lets see an example: \n"
