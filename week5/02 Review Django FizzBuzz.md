# Django Fizz Buzz

Each group needs to create a django project and a django app.  The project will have 1 view at the url /fizzbuzz/

The page (there must be a template using django bootstrap) needs to do the following:
1 Loop from 1 to 100
2 If the number is divisible by 3 then print fizz
3 If the number is divisible by 5 then print buzz
4 If the number is divisible by both then print fizzbuzz
5 If the number is not divisible by either print the number
